# Hi, I'm Veejhay 👋

I'm a high schooler who loves **machine learning** and building things that sit at the intersection of AI and the real world. I’m especially interested in how models reason, use tools, and handle structured tasks, and I like turning that interest into projects and research.

## What I'm up to

### RouteEval — LLM research with an MIT graduate

With **Roger Jin** (MIT, Nous Research), I co-authored and ran **RouteEval**: a benchmark for evaluating how well large language models generate running routes through **tool calling**. We evaluated 13 state-of-the-art models (GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, Grok, and others) on 50 prompts with 16 runs each, validated routes with Google Maps, and analyzed success rates and distance accuracy. The work is written up in a full paper, and all evaluation data and leaderboards are open-sourced.

- **[RouteEval repo](https://github.com/vjroy/routeeval)** — paper, data, leaderboards  
- **[routecraft.io](https://routecraft.io)** — live demo: generate running routes with different LLMs

### HarvardX — Data Science

I completed the **HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate** (R, visualization, probability, inference, modeling, linear algebra, multivariable calculus). It gave me a rigerous mathematical base that I use in my ML and research work.

### Columbia — Data Science

This past summer I was in **Columbia’s Data Science** summer program where I took part in their Data science II course. It deepend my exposure to statistical and computational methods and how they’re applied in real datasets and pipelines. For our final project, we created a machine learning model to detect credit card fraud which received a 0.97 PR-AUC score.

### Track app

I co-built a **track & field app** to help athletes plan and analyze their training. It combines practical use (workouts, progress) with the kind of structured data and UX thinking that carries over into building tools like Routecraft and thinking about how AI can support real-world tasks. Currently, it has over 100+ atheletes.

### Routecraft

**[Routecraft](https://routecraft.io)** is the live product of the RouteEval research: an LLM-powered running route generator. You describe the run you want (distance, location, style), pick a model, and get a route with waypoints and directions. It’s the same tool-calling setup we benchmark in the paper, so the site doubles as a demo of what we’re measuring.
